## Note on API Usage

This tool utilizes the `translate.googleapis.com` endpoint for translation. This is primarily for demonstration and light, personal usage. For more robust, scalable, or commercial applications, it is highly recommended to:

*   Obtain your own API key for the Google Cloud Translation API.
*   Adhere to Google's terms of service for API usage.

Using the public endpoint directly without an API key may be subject to rate limiting or other restrictions.
